## Requirements

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   
   You can obtain a Gemini API key by:
   1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   2. Sign in with your Google account
   3. Create a new API key
   4. Copy the API key and paste it in the `.env` file

   > **IMPORTANT**: The application will not work without a valid Gemini API key. If you encounter a 500 Internal Server Error, this is likely the cause.

5. Start the backend server:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and doesn't require any build steps.

1. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser while the backend server is running.
